        <p>My name is Swarnim Marathe. While my primary professional focus lies within the realm of computer science and programming, I also maintain a strong interest in the strategic elements of VALORANT esports, following the competitive scene and analyzing gameplay. Beyond the digital sphere, I prioritize maintaining physical fitness through calisthenics and weighlifting routines. To balance out my analytical side, I enjoy delving into the world of cinema and appreciate the power of storytelling. Additionally, I possess a deep fascination with philosophy and psychology (excluding the clinical realm), driven by a desire to understand the complexities of the human mind and the world around us. As an INTJ-A, I approach these diverse interests with a logical and analytical mind, constantly seeking new knowledge and forging connections between seemingly disparate ideas.</p>
